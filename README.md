# Analysis Code for 'Defining and Reducing Variant Classification Disparities'


1. First clone and download the github repository. Then download the input data

    Go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sdp27bSK-N4LlDRI3Fmqu9N00xuIVxnx?usp=drive_link

    In the google drive there will be two folders: requiredinputs and exampleoutput. Put all the files without changing their names from the requiredinputs folder into the inputs folder (from the cloned and downloaded github repo). The exampleoutput folder is for comparison. Total download size for all the files is about ~12.5 GB.

    
    

2. Run notebook from top to bottom in order. If the entire github repository is downloaded and the contents are kept in the same order then you can click the 'Run all below' button.


3. The version of Python 3.7.7 was used to run this notebook is:


4. The R version is R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31). This is very pertinent for the rpy2 installation. If possible install rpy2 v3.5.7 and ggstatsplots v0.12.1


5. Please make sure to use a similar and compatible version of python otherwise some packages may be outdated or function differently.


6. Will take around 8-9 hours to produce all figures and tables found in the paper (including main text figures and supplement and a few additional figures) for gnomAD v2.1.1 and gnomAD v3.1.2 (non v2). The figures and tables used in the paper can be found in-line as outputs of this jupyter notebook as well as in the output folder.


7. Per the policy of the All of Us program, the code, inputs, and outputs for the All of Us analyses are in a declared workspace in the All of Us workbench. The code in the All of Us workspace is the same as below with modifications made for the specific data requirements of the All of Us platform. After publication, the workspace will be gladly and immediately shared with approved users upon request.
